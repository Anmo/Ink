# Welcome to [Ink](http://ink.sapo.pt)

Ink is an interface kit for quick development of web interfaces, simple to use and expand on. It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to offer modern solutions for building layouts, display common interface elements and implement interactive features that are content-centric and user friendly for both your audience and your designers & developers.

## Current Version: 3.0.0-WIP

We're moving the CSS generation over to SASS + COMPASS and working on some new exciting stuff.
Stay tuned.

## Repository branches
    
We have three branches on our github repository:

* The **[master](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/master)** branch contains the latest release as its HEAD and all previous releases as tags.
* The **[develop](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/develop)** branch contains our latest code that will eventually lead to a new release and tag on **[master](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/master)**. This branch is likely to contain code that is not fully functional or documented. Use at your own risk.
* The **[staging](https://github.com/sapo/Ink/tree/staging)** branch is a semi-stable branch containing code from the develop branch which is going to go into the next release.

To get a specific release clone the repository and use, e.g. `git checkout 1.0.0`.

## JavaScript modules

The Ink JavaScript modules used to be in a separate repository. Now they are in the `src/js` folder. Check out the `README.md` file inside with further information regarding those modules.


## Building from source

If you wish to compile our source code you'll need a couple of things:

+ [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
+ [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)
+ [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

After installing these dependencies simple run the `npm install` and `grunt` from your terminal.
