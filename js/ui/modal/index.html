            The Modal Window component allows you to place content in the form of
            a dialog window that takes center stage and fades out the rest of your
            content, allowing you to focus attention on that content and even require
            a certain action from your users to dismiss, or interact with that window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ink's Modal Window component is basically a bit of HTML and a Javascript
            instruction, so it's really easy to use and very flexible, allowing you
            to easily add text, images, videos, iframes, you name it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Modal Window is also really easy to configure, like our other components,
            simply by using data-attributes. Let's see how to get started.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Necessary JS modules
        </h3>
        <p>
            Before you begin, make sure you're including the necessary Javascript
            inside your
            <code>
                &lt;head&gt;
            </code>
            , you'll need ink.js, ink.modal.js and autoload.js to initialize the module
            automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ink-label info">
                Code
            </span>
        </p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/ink.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/ink.modal.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/js/autoload.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            If you opted for not using the autoload feature, then you'll need to initialize
            the Modal component by hand. Simply include the following code, at the
            end of your page, before the closing
            <code>
                &lt;body&gt;
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ink-label info">
                Code
            </span>
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
            &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; // There are two ways
            to run the code... // 1 - If you know you have the component and its dependencies
            already loaded, just do: var modal = new Ink.UI.Modal( '#test' ); // 2
            - If you're not sure the component or its dependencies are loaded at runtime,
            do: Ink.requireModules( ['Ink.UI.Modal_1'], function(Modal){ new Modal(
            '#test' ); }); &lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
        <h3>
            Building the window
        </h3>
        <p>
            First, you need to create two wrappers, by using two
            <code>
                &lt;div&gt;
            </code>
            . The first one must have the
            <code>
                .ink-shade
            </code>
            class, and takes care of darkening the background in order to make your
            modal window float above the rest of the page. The second one, inside the
            first, must have the
            <code>
                .ink-modal
            </code>
            class, to take care of setting up your window.
        </p>
        <p>
            The
            <code>
                .ink-modal
            </code>
            wrapper is the configurable bit of the window, which you can change by
            using data-attributes. Let's look at just the most common one, for now,
            which allows you to fire up your window from another element, such as a
            link:
            <code>
                data-trigger="#myModal"
            </code>
            , this ID (in the example "myModal"), will be targetted by the Javascript
            instruction which will render the window onscreen; you can change the ID
            to whatever suits your particular case. If you don't use this attribute,
            the modal window will simply be created on page load, which is actually
            something you may want, so all our data-attributes are optional.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's a lot more you can configure with data-attributes, but let's stay
            with the basic for now and we'll give you a list of all the parameters
            and their values further ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, up to now, you have this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ink-label info">
                Code
            </span>
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
            &lt;div class=&quot;ink-shade&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;ink-modal&quot;
            data-trigger=&quot;#myModal&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
            That is the skelleton for the modal window. To add some content, you can
            create three
            <code>
                &lt;div&gt;
            </code>
            , one for each of the
            <code>
                .modal-header
            </code>
            ,
            <code>
                .modal-body
            </code>
            and
            <code>
                .modal-footer
            </code>
            elements, inside the
            <code>
                .ink-modal
            </code>
            container. These are self-explanatory and you can add whatever you want
            inside them, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, videos, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll need an interactive element to close your window, so Ink offers
            the
            <code>
                .ink-dismiss
            </code>
            class, which you can add to pretty much anything: an anchor, a button,
            a piece of text or an image which, when clicked by the user, will cause
            the modal window to be dismissed. There is also a
            <code>
                .modal-close
            </code>
            class which specifically renders a small "X" button in your modal window
            to keep up with the familiarity factor from general users. Add it to a
            button, together with the dismiss class, in your modal window's header
            element, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see what we have so far, then:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ink-label info">
                Code
            </span>
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
            &lt;div class=&quot;ink-shade&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;ink-modal&quot;
            data-trigger=&quot;#myModal&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;modal-header&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;!--Add a title and a close button here--&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;modal-body&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;!--Add some text and an image, or a form, here--&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;modal-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;!--Add your submit button and a close button, here--&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
            Simple enough, right? Now you need a link or a button to fire up your
            modal window, just make sure it has the same ID as you defined before.
            In our case: "myModal"
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ink-label info">
                Code
            </span>
        </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
            &lt;button id=&quot;#myModal&quot;&gt;Open My Modal&lt;/button&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
            <span class="ink-label info">
                Hint
            </span>
            We suggest you add the
            <code>
                .fade
            </code>
            class to your
            <code>
                .ink-shade
            </code>
            container, to obtain a fade-in/fade-out transition for your modal window.

            Configurable data attributes
        </h3>
        <p>
            As you can see in the example code above, there are several data-attributes
            you can use to configure your window. In our case, we defined a certain
            width and height, but there's more you can use, just check out the list
            below and remember that these are all optional.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <!-- <li>HTML formatted messages</li> -->
            <li>
                <strong>
                    data-width
                </strong>
                and
                <strong>
                    data-height
                </strong>
                define the size of your window and must be a valid unit, such as
                <code>
                    px
                </code>
                ,
                <code>
                    em
                </code>
                or
                <code>
                    %
                </code>
                . Example:
                <code>
                    data-width="300px"
                </code>
                <code>
                    data-height="600px"
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    data-trigger
                </strong>
                allows you to specify one or more elements that will trigger you modal
                window, it must be a valid CSS selector. Example:
                <code>
                    data-trigger="#button"
                </code>
                . If you don't use this property, the modal window will be rendered as
                soon as it's created.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    data-trigger-event
                </strong>
                lets you specify in what event will the window be triggered, must be used
                together with
                <code>
                    data-trigger
                </code>
                and must be a valid Javascript event. Example:
                <code>
                    data-trigger-event="mouseover"
                </code>
                .
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    data-responsive
                </strong>
                makes your window respond to changes in viewport width, must be "true"
                (default) or "false". Example:
                <code>
                    data-responsive="false"
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    data-close-on-click
                </strong>
                defines whether or not your modal window will close if you click anywhere
                in the viewport, outside said window. Must be "true" or "false" (default).
                Example:
                <code>
                    data-close-on-click="true"
                </code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    data-disable-scroll
                </strong>
                allows you to disable scolling your page behind the modal window. Values
                are "true" (default) or "false". Example:
                <code>
                    data-disable-scroll="false"
                </code>
