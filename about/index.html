                <p>
                    Ink is an interface kit for quick development of web interfaces, simple to use and expand on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to offer modern solutions for building layouts, 
                    display common interface elements and implement interactive features that are content-centric and user friendly for both your audience and your designers & developers.
                </p>
                <p>You have several options to use Ink:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download and use CSS and our boilerplate HTML as is</li>
                    <li>Create your customizations using CSS or <a href="http://lesscss.org/">{LESS}</a></li>
                    <li>Just grab snippets of markup and CSS off our documentation to solve specific problems</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why use Ink</h2>
                <p>
                    Ink presents a unique vision of what a front end framework should be. 
                    More than a ready made solution (although it can be that), we went for a building block approach. 
                    By offering generic components that you can use in different contexts to obtain consistent results, Ink is both flexible and powerful while remaining easy to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our grid system is different from any other currently out there as it offers you true flexibility to build your layouts. 
                    Because it's all percentage-based, the grid is truly fluid and you don't have to count columns and rely on memorizing offsets and spans. 
                    Just naturally divide up your space in 10 to 100% blocks, divided into the most common steps, such as halves, quarters, fifths, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As to styling, we offer generic styling classes which can be applied to many elements in different contexts to obtain a consistent result. 
                    Say you want a zebra-stripe table but also a zebra-stripe list. 
                    With Ink, you use the same class <code>.ink-zebra</code> and the CSS takes care of applying correct layout and styling according to what type of markup element you used it on.</p>
                <p>
                    This makes Ink very easy to learn and reuse over time, making your life easier. 
                    And with a quick configurator, you can change the properties of any styling class so that the default <code>.ink-warning</code> class is no longer red with white text, but becomes yellow with red text, for example. 
                    You can then consistently use <code>.ink-warning</code> to get a red paragraph on a yellow background, or a yellow button with red text or even a yellow table row with red text in the table cells.
                </p>

            <section id="nav-who" data-spy="true" data-target="#about_menu">
                <h2>Who we are</h2>
                <p>
                    We are SAPO. You might mistake us for a small startup, because that's our spirit. 
                    We are in fact Portugal's largest internet enterprise with businesses ranging from content and advertising to services and app development, all based on a solid, 17-year old web brand and integrated into a multinational telecommunications company, Portugal Telecom.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="nav-store" data-spy="true" data-target="#about_menu">
                <h2>What's in store</h2>
                <p>
                    We want to keep up with the times, while keeping Ink flexible and easy to use. 
                    We'll be revising and updating the framework using a major-version scheme in order to keep previous versions solid and not force updates to anyone who doesn't want them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll also be expanding Ink to be a lot more than just a framework or a collection of Javascript components and code snippets. 
                    We'll be adding design patterns and publishing a huge knowledge base of best practices in design, coding, usability, accessibility and more, making Ink your one-stop reference for web front-end development and design.
