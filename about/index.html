    <h1 class="fw-300">What it is</h1>
    <p>
        Ink is an interface kit for quick development of web interfaces, simple to use and expand on. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to offer modern solutions for building layouts, 
        display common interface elements and implement interactive features that are content-centric and user friendly for both your audience and your designers & developers.
    </p>
    <p>You have several options to use Ink:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Download and use CSS and our boilerplate HTML as is</li>
        <li>Create your customizations using CSS or <a href="http://lesscss.org/">{LESS}</a></li>
        <li>Just grab snippets of markup and CSS off our documentation to solve specific problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="fw-300">Why use Ink</h1>
    <p>
        Ink presents a unique vision of what a front end framework should be. 
        More than a ready made solution (although it can be that), we went for a building block approach. 
        By offering generic components that you can use in different contexts to obtain consistent results, Ink is both flexible and powerful while remaining easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our grid system is different from any other currently out there as it offers you true flexibility to build your layouts. 
        Because it's all percentage-based, the grid is truly fluid and you don't have to count columns and rely on memorizing offsets and spans. 
        Just naturally divide up your space in 10 to 100% blocks, divided into the most common steps, such as halves, quarters, fifths, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        As to styling, we offer generic styling classes which can be applied to many elements in different contexts to obtain a consistent result. 
        Say you want a zebra-stripe table but also a zebra-stripe list. 
        With Ink, you use the same class <code>.ink-zebra</code> and the CSS takes care of applying correct layout and styling according to what type of markup element you used it on.</p>
    <p>
        This makes Ink very easy to learn and reuse over time, making your life easier. 
        And with a quick configurator, you can change the properties of any styling class so that the default <code>.ink-warning</code> class is no longer red with white text, but becomes yellow with red text, for example. 
        You can then consistently use <code>.ink-warning</code> to get a red paragraph on a yellow background, or a yellow button with red text or even a yellow table row with red text in the table cells.

    <h1 class="fw-300">Who we are</h1>
    <p>
        We are SAPO. You might mistake us for a small startup, because that's our spirit. 
        We are in fact Portugal's largest internet enterprise with businesses ranging from content and advertising to services and app development, all based on a solid, 17-year old web brand and integrated into a multinational telecommunications company, Portugal Telecom.

    <h1 class="fw-300">What's in store</h1>
    <p>
        We want to keep up with the times, while keeping Ink flexible and easy to use. 
        We'll be revising and updating the framework using a major-version scheme in order to keep previous versions solid and not force updates to anyone who doesn't want them.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll also be expanding Ink to be a lot more than just a framework or a collection of Javascript components and code snippets. 
        We'll be adding design patterns and publishing a huge knowledge base of best practices in design, coding, usability, accessibility and more, making Ink your one-stop reference for web front-end development and design.
